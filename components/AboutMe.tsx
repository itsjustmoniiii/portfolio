          My journey began in high school. Here my passion for creativity
          developed in different fields - programming as well as designing. It
          was immediately clear to me that my heart was in these areas and that
          I wanted to pursue this career path. So I started my bachelor studies
          in &quot;Media Technology&quot; at the University of Applied Sciences
          in St.PÃ¶lten and to this day I don&apos;t regret for a second that I
          took this path. During this time, I was able to learn an incredible
          amount and am already looking forward to my master&apos;s degree.
